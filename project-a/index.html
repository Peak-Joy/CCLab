                Discovered in the deepest parts of the Atlantic ocean, the Arachnoteuthis is a hybrid between a spider 
                and an octopus that feeds off of smaller fish caught by its web. It lives in bioluminescent underwater 
                caves and camouflages itself by changing colors to blend in with its surroundings. When small fish 
                enter the cave it shoots a packet of webs that expand after contact, trapping the fish to consume. 
                The creature uses its tentacles to attach itself to the cave walls and crawl around like a spider as 
                its web sack makes it too buoyant to swim effectively. It is aggressive but not lethal to humans as it 
                has no venom and it is too small to devour humans, but being too curious can lead to missing fingers. 
                It will shoot its webs at humans and chase them around.

                and if you get too close (click the mouse) it will attempt to shoot its web at you
