                Discovered in the deepest parts of the Atlantic ocean, the Arachnoteuthis is a hybrid between a spider 
                and an octopus that feeds off of smaller fish by absorbing the nutrients in it's outer shell. It lives in bioluminescent underwater 
                caves and camouflages itself by changing colors to blend in with its surroundings.  
                The creature uses its tentacles to attach itself to the cave floor and crawl around like a spider as 
                its web sack makes it too buoyant to swim effectively. It is aggressive but not lethal to humans as it 
                has no venom and it is too small to devour humans, but being too curious can lead to missing fingers. 
                <br>
                <span class="yellow">Guidelines for human interaction with this creature</span> This creature will crawl around the floor chasing you 
                and if you get too far it will stretch to still follow you.
